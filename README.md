Toy Jumper

~~Game Controls~~
WASD - control the main character when in 2D view (alternatively you can use arrow keys)
Q - Change from 3D to 2D
SPACE - Jump when in 3D view
R - Return to level select


At the start of each level, you are placed in a 3D scene with the puzzle. You can click on blocks to move them around. Pressing Q will enter the 2D perspective and you will be controlling your character with the left and right arrow keys, or W and D. You can press space to jump.  

The goal is to collect all the keys in the level, which are spread out throughout the various screens (on the various blocks). If two blocks are next to each other and have connecting screens, you can walk the player through the connecting door to enter the other screen.  

Stepping on legos hurts! Beware of small traps placed on the ground that will reset the level. If at any point youâ€™d like to restart the level, simply press R.
